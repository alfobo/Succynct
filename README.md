# Succynct

A simple file and folder synchonization script. Simply add the source file/folder, destination, intervals and you're good to go.

Option(s):

- -m: Modify the current configuration

This is a small project meant for me to learn a bit of bash, while still having some pratical use.

- Capabilities to add more than one source file/folder
